# AWS CloudFormation Template Library

This library provides a collection of AWS CloudFormation templates that allow you to easily build AWS infrastructure.

## Features

* Pre-built templates for common AWS infrastructure setups.
* Easy to use and customize for your specific needs.
* Supports a wide range of AWS services.

## AWS Resources

### Servers & EC2

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) provides scalable computing capacity in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud. Using Amazon EC2 eliminates your need to invest in hardware up front, so you can develop and deploy applications faster. This library includes templates for setting up EC2 instances, configuring security groups, and more.

### RDS

Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. It provides cost-efficient and resizable capacity while automating time-consuming administration tasks. Our templates cover various RDS configurations, including multi-AZ deployments and read replicas.

### CodePipelines

AWS CodePipeline is a fully managed continuous delivery service that helps you automate your release pipelines for fast and reliable application and infrastructure updates. The library provides templates for setting up CodePipeline, including source control, build, and deployment stages.

### VPCs

Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) lets you provision a logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you define. The templates in this library help you set up VPCs with public and private subnets, route tables, and internet gateways.

### Lambda

AWS Lambda lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. You pay only for the compute time you consume. The library includes templates for creating Lambda functions, setting up API Gateway triggers, and configuring IAM roles for Lambda.
